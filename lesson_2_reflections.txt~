Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. When you initialize a repository, a .git directory containing metadata is set up. This is needed to start the process of version tracking.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. The staging area just contains information about changes to be made. The working directory contains the current state of the system, and the repository the entire history. It allows control to be exercised over changes to be made.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A. Use "git add" to add just the changes associated with one logical change to the staging area before each commit.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A. If you wish to make experimental changes to test out possible new features.

Q. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A. The diagrams show the connections from each commit to it's parent.

Q. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A. Merging two branches together combines the changes made in two different branches into one branch. It is represented in the diagram as a child with two parent commits, showing that the branch has inherited changes from two different branches.
