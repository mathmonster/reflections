Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. You would do this if you wanted to share a repository with other users, or wanted to access the same repository yourself from multiple machines.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. You may be working on local code changes that are not automatically compatible with the remote repository, but need to be merged manually.
